CSS: Adding Presentation Layer
==============================
In this project, I made Coin Toss game and linked it to a newly created html layout. I used various CSS methods to style the nav menu, header, borders, colors, buttons, background etc. The nav menu are just for display purposes only and therefore does not link to any particular reference. I found it pretty straight forward and easy to learn. I used Noramalize.css because it preserves useful defaults rather than "unstyling" everything and supposedly corrects some common bugs that are out of scope for reset.css. Normalize CSS aims to make built-in browser styling consistent across browsers and add only the difference in decoration your design needs, unlike Reset.CSS that aims to remove all built-in browser styling then supposedly add all decorations yourself.
